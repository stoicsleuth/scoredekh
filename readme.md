# Get Live IPL Updates

![](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-javascript.svg)

## Description
An Electron App to get live notification for every **four**, **six** and **wicket** for ongoing matches of IPL (Indian Premiere League).

Inspired by [https://github.com/rowhitswami/IPL_Live_Updates](https://github.com/rowhitswami/IPL_Live_Updates)


## Prerequisites

NodeJS and npm will be required to run this app, so if you don't have them, install right away.

Download Node from [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

npm will be installed along with Node. Check the version using 
```
node -v``` 
```
And npm version using
```
npm -v
```
Additionally, we would need to install electron-forge cli to run the application locally and to help package and distribute to mac/win/linux environments.
```
npm i @electron-forge/cli
```
Once it's installed, we're good to go!


## Run Script

Clone/download the repository.

Open Terminal or Command Prompt and type
```
npm install
```
Run/start the application locally using 
```
npm start
```

## Bonus

In the event of a sixer, the application would open Swiggy to utilize the coupon code SWIGGY6.
